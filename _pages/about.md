I am a Robotics Ph.D. student at the University of Washington, where I work on safe autonomy with Professor Karen Leung. 

I received my MS in Robotics and BS in Electrical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology. During my MS, I worked on imitation learning for robot safety with Professor Matthew Gombolay. During my BS, I worked on perception for manipulators and wheeled robots with Professor Patricio Vela. 

I also had the wonderful opportunity to work with John Dolan at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
