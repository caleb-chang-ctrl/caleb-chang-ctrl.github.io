Hi! I’m a Robotics Ph.D. student in the [Control & Trustworthy Robotics Lab](https://depts.washington.edu/ctrl/) at the University of Washington, advised by Professor [Karen Leung](https://faculty.washington.edu/kymleung/). 

My research sits at the intersection of control theory, machine learning, and human–robot interaction. I focus on developing personalized, safe, and trustworthy methods for interactive autonomy that move beyond simple collision avoidance. I aim to equip robots with a deeper understanding of human and task context, ensuring their behavior aligns seamlessly with human intent and preferences.

Previously, I received an M.S. in Robotics and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Georgia Tech. During my Master’s, I conducted research on imitation learning for robot safety with Professor [Matthew Gombolay](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/people/matthew-gombolay). As an undergraduate, I focused on perception and planning for manipulators and autonomous vehicles with Professor [Patricio Vela](https://ece.gatech.edu/directory/patricio-antonio-vela). I also worked on safety-critical control with [John Dolan](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-m-dolan/) at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute.
